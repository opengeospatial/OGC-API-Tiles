== Requirement Class "Tiles Core"

=== Overview

[[tiles-core-overview]]

include::requirements/tiles/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

An API that implements this conformance class provides access to tiled resources of a link:https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-dataset[dataset]. In other words, the API enables the link:https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-distribution[distribution] of that dataset.  An implementation of OGC API - Features standard, for example, could be another distribution.

The entry point is a `Landing page` (path `/`).

The `Landing page` provides links to:

* the `API definition` (path `/api`, link relation `service-desc`),
* the `Conformance declaration` (path `/conformance`, link relation `conformance`), and
* the `Collections` (path `/collections`, link relation `data`).

The `API definition` describes the capabilities of the API instance that can be used by clients to retrieve resources from the API or by development tools to support the implementation of API servers and clients. Accessing the `API definition` using HTTP GET returns a description of the API.

The `Conformance declaration` states the requirements classes from standards or community specifications, identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), that the API conforms to. Clients can, but are not required to, use this information. Accessing the `Conformance declaration` using HTTP GET returns the list of URIs of requirements classes implemented by the API.

The core of the OGC API - Tiles draft specification (as defined in this chapter) does not mandate the inclusion of an explicit definition of any TileMatrixSet. This draft specification assumes that clients and services know about the eight TileMatrixSets defined in OGC 17-083r2 annex D and there is no need to communicate these definitions. An extension to the core provides the capability to include definitions of flexible TileMatrixSets that are explicitly defined.

This draft specification assumes that data is organized into one or more collections. `Collections` provides information about the collections and enumerate the collection identifier.

This document does not specify requirements for collections, and they can consist of features, coverages, a resource that does not represent data per-se (e.g. an annotation) any other resource that can be represented in a tile. collectionId replaces the concept of layer in WMS and WMTS. Maps or tiles can be generated from one collection (or a combination of collections as an extension).

Accessing `Collections` using HTTP GET returns a response that contains at least the list of collections. Accessing `Collections/{collectionId}` using HTTP GET returns a description of a collection with an indication of whether the collection can be retrieved as a map or a tile or both. Accessing the items of a collection is out of the scope of this draft specification but is described in other draft OGC API specifications for features or coverages, for instance. For each `Collection`, a link to metadata about the collection is available (path `/collections/{collectionId}`) with key information about the collection. This information includes:

* A local identifier for the collection that is unique for the dataset;
* An optional title and description for the collection;
* An optional extent that can be used to provide an indication of the spatial and temporal extent of the collection - typically derived from the data;
* A list of TileMatrixSetLink objects relating to the available tiling schemas supported by the collection (from the linked TileMatrixSet member, the client can determine the coordinate reference systems (CRS) in which tiles may be returned by the API)

The `Collection` resource is available at path `/collections/{collectionId}`, often with more details than included in the `Collections` response. In particular, there is a list of links. If there is a link to more metadata about tiles, the collection is available directly as tiles. In the metadata about tiles there are also links and at least one of these links will provide the template to get individual tiles.

=== General
include::requirements/tiles/core/REQ_api-common.adoc[]

In practice, this means that the landing page and the conformance page follow OGC API - Common core and collections requirement classes. This draft specification provides extra additions to the OGC API - Common requirements that are particular to tiles.

=== API landing page

The landing page provides links to start exploring the resources offered by the API. The landing page mainly consists of a list of links. OGC API - Common already requires some common links that are enough for this draft specification core.

==== Response
There are no required variations to the landing page.

=== Declaration of conformance classes

To support "generic" clients that want to access multiple OGC API standards and extensions - and not "just" a specific API / server, the API has to declare the requirements classes it implements and conforms to.

==== Response

The conformance page mainly consists of a list of links. OGC API - Common already requires some links.

include::requirements/tiles/core/REQ_conformance-success.adoc[]

In the conformance page (typically in JSON format) the links follow the link schema defined in the OGC API - Common. Below is an example fragment of the response to an OGC API - Tiles conformance information page.

    "http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-tiles-1/1.0/req/core"
  ]
}
=================

=== Collections
This draft specification includes dependencies on OGC API - Common collections. Collections are mandatory in the core of this draft specification because collections are the object that will be included in a tile.

Collections will enumerate the collectionId identifiers available in this implementation of the OGC API draft specification as well as basic information about each collectionId: id, title, description, extent, CRS and links. This common response is considered enough for a general description of the collection.

include::requirements/tiles/core/REQ_tc-md-collection-links.adoc[]

More specific details about the collection can be found following the link to the individual collections that follow the pattern /collections/{collectionId}

NOTE: The collectionId substitutes the concept of "layer" in WMTS 1.0.

=== Collection
This draft specification includes dependencies on the OGC API - Common collection requirement. The response to the operation is extended with a new link for the tiles description.

==== Collection Links

=== Tiles description
The response to this operation contains the necessary metadata to enable a client application to formulate a tile request from a single collection.

==== Operation

include::requirements/tiles/core/REQ_sct-op.adoc[]

The request of this operation has no parameters.

==== Response

A successful response to a tiles request for a collection that can be retrieved as tiles will respond with a data structure with specific information necessary to get tiles representing the resource collection. In this core draft specification, the response is only required to inform about from which tile matrix sets tiles can be retrieved and the URL template to a tile.

Resolvable URLs for the 8 URIs defined in the OGC 17-083r2 Annex D are available in the OGC schemas repository in XML, JSON and RDF formats. For example, JSON descriptions can be found here: http://schemas.opengis.net/tms/1.0/json/examples/

include::requirements/tiles/core/REQ_sct-tile-examples.adoc[]

One common order used in URL templates for tiles is .../tiles/{tileMatrixSetId}/{tileMatrix}/{tileRow}/{tileCol}, but this draft specification allows for other URL template composition.

=== Tiled data from one collection

The core of the OGC API -Tiles draft specification provides a mechanism to select and retrieve a tile in a TileMatrixSet. If the service does not advertise any other TileMatrixSet (this core does not describe any mechanism to do that, but an extension will do it) only the TileMatrixSet identifiers specified in the Annex D.1 of the OGC 17-083r2 standard can be used.

==== Operation

include::requirements/tiles/core/REQ_tc-op.adoc[]

Typical resources that can be retrieved as tiles are: features (/collections/{collectionId}), coverages (/collections/{collectionId}/coverage/{coverageId} or /coverage/{coverageId}) or maps (/collections/{collectionId}/map/styleId}).

NOTE: The common path for coverages is still under discussion.

==== Parameter tileMatrixSetId
include::requirements/tiles/core/REQ_tc-tilematrixsetid-definition.adoc[]

==== Parameter tileMatrix
include::requirements/tiles/core/REQ_tc-tilematrix-definition.adoc[]

==== Parameter tileRow
include::requirements/tiles/core/REQ_tc-tilerow-definition.adoc[]

==== Parameter tileCol
include::requirements/tiles/core/REQ_tc-tilecol-definition.adoc[]

==== Response

A successful response to a tile request will be consistent with the media type of resource requested. This draft specification does not impose any media type. For example:

* For features the media type can be geojson or Mapbox vector tiles;
* For coverages the response may be a geotiff;
* For maps the response may be a jpeg or a png.

include::requirements/tiles/core/REQ_tc-success.adoc[]

Normally, the content partially outside the tile bounding box will be clipped and this is particularly true when tiles are in raster format. Nevertheless, tiles containing features in vector format may not clip features that are partially outside.

include::recommendations/tiles/core/REC_tc-success-scale.adoc[]

==== Error conditions

A general summary of the HTTP status codes can be found in the OGC API - Common.

If the parameter value `tileMatrixSetId` is not available by the server for this resource or the parameters values `tileMatrix`, `tileRow`, `tileCol` are out-of-range, the status code of the response will be 404.
