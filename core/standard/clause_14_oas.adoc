== Requirements class "OpenAPI 3.0"

NOTE: THIS SECTION REQUIRES A CAREFUL REVIEW. PLEASE IGNORE IT

[NOTE]
========
The OAS requirements class should be limited to OpenAPI 3.0 requirements that specific to Map Tile resources. These requirements are an extension to the OpenAPI requirements in OAPI Common.

What follows is from OAPI common.  It should be replaced with appropriate Map Tile centered requirements.
========

=== Basic requirements

APIs conforming to this requirements class document themselves by an link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#oasDocument[OpenAPI Document].

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/117[ISSUE 117] +
The OpenAPI media type has not been registered yet with IANA and will likely change. We need to update the media type after registration.

CAUTION: Related to link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/90[ISSUE 90] +
If we have a rigid path pattern there seems to be no need to add requirements for fixed operationId values. However, if the path pattern would be flexible, maybe we should require specific operationIds for selected resources?

Two example OpenAPI documents are included in <<oas30_example,Annex B>>.

=== Complete definition

include::requirements/oas30/REQ_completeness.adoc[]

Note that APIs that, for example, are access-controlled (see <<security,Security>>), support web cache validation, CORS or that use HTTP redirection will make use of additional HTTP status codes beyond regular codes such as `200` for successful GET requests and `400`, `404` or `500` for error situations. See <<http_status_codes>>.

Clients have to be prepared to receive responses not documented in the OpenAPI definition. For example, additional errors may occur in the transport layer outside of the server.

=== Exceptions

[[security]]
=== Security

include::requirements/oas30/REQ_security.adoc[]

The OpenAPI specification currently supports the following link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#security-scheme-object[security schemes]:

* HTTP authentication,
* an API key (either as a header or as a query parameter),
* OAuth2's common flows (implicit, password, application and access code) as defined in RFC6749, and
* OpenID Connect Discovery.

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/41[ISSUE 41] +
How does a client determine which security protocols/standards/etc. a server supports?
