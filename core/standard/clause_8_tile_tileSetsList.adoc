== Requirement Class "TileSets List"

=== Overview

[[tiles-core-overview]]

include::requirements/requirements_class_tilesets-list.adoc[]

Defines the response of a TileSets GET request for which the response includes a list of available tilesets. It defines a relation type to link to tileset resources.

**TBD**

This is a building block for the an OGC API that is able to provide geospatial data resources. When applying the building block to a geospatial data resource, it becomes available as tiles. The server can select which resources are available as tiles and will advertise which resources are available as tiles.

This building block does not specify how to get an API definition, the conformance class list or the geospatial data resources lists. The standard assumes that the first two are defined by an API specification (e.g. OGC API Common) and the later by an OGC API for geospatial data resource (e.g. OGC API - Features).

The core of the OGC API - Tiles core draft specification does not mandate the inclusion of an explicit definition of any TileMatrixSet. This draft specification assumes that clients and services know about the eight TileMatrixSets defined in OGC 17-083r2 annex D (or compatible future update of it) and there is no need to define new TileMatrixSets. An extension to the core provides the capability to include definitions of flexible TileMatrixSets that are explicitly defined.

This draft specification assumes that data is organized into one or more geospatial data resources (e.g. the "collections" in http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0[OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core]). Geospatial data resources are referenced using URIs.

This document does not specify any requirements for the type of geospatial data resource that should be supported. Provided that the geospatial data resources can be organized into tiles, they can be supported regardless of whether they are features, coverages, a resource that does not represent data per-se (e.g. an annotation) and so forth. The resource path replaces the concept of layer in WMS and WMTS. In this core tiles can be generated from only one geospatial data resource (tiles that are generated as a combination of geospatial data resources will be defined as an extension).

Accessing the geospatial data resource content (other than as tiles) or its descriptions is out of the scope of this draft specification. If a description of the geospatial data resource exists and it has a mechanism to add links to it, this specification will indicate the need to add a link to the tile description.

The tile description will include metadata about tiles as well as links to other resources including at least one with a template to get individual tiles.

**End of TBD**

=== Declaration of conformance classes

To support "generic" clients that want to access multiple OGC API standards and extensions - and not "just" a specific API / server, the API has to declare the requirements classes it implements and conforms to.

==== Response

The conformance page mainly consists of a list of links.

include::requirements/tilesets-list/REQ_conformance-success.adoc[]

If the server declares also conformity to OGC API - Common or to http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0[OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core, version 1.0], then it has to consider the OGC API - Common requirements for declaring conformance, i.e. the use of a the conformance page. In the JSON format the conformance page is an array of links following the link schema defined in the OGC API - Common or in http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0[OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core, version 1.0]. Below is an example fragment of a conformance information page of an API conformant to OGC API - Common and OGC API - Tiles.

=== Tilesets
A tilesets resource represents a list of sets of tiles each one belonging to a particular tilematrixset. The resource contains the necessary metadata to enable a client application to formulate a tile request.

==== Tilesets path
This class does not specify the path for a tileSets. Refer to the DatasetTileSets and GeoDataResourceTileSets classes that describes two mechanisms to associate tileSets to datasets and to geospatial data resources respectively.

==== Response

A successful GET response to a list of tilesets resource will respond with a data structure that lists the tileset URLS available (one for each Tile Matrix Set supported).
