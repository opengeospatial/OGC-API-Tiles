^|A |The content of the response to a successful execution of a tileset SHALL include at least a link to a tile URI template (rel: `item`).
^|B |These links SHALL provide a URL template with the fragment `/tiles` followed by the value of the tileMatrixSet identifier and a URI template that makes use of the following URL template variables {tileMatrix}, {tileRow}, {tileCol}. Once the variables are substituted by their respective valid values, a URL to a tile is obtained.
^|C |There SHALL be a link to a tile URI template for each file format that the server supports (the format is indicated in the 'type' attribute of the link)
^|D |A property `templated` SHALL be part of the link properties to indicate that the link needs to be processed to substitute the templated variables with valid values before being used as a URL to a tile.
^|E |The results of this operation SHALL return a single tile that represents information sourced from geospatial data resources.
