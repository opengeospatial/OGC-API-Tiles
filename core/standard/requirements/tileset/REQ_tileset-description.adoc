^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/tileset/description*
^|A |The HTTP GET response for a specific tileset SHALL follow the https://github.com/opengeospatial/2D-Tile-Matrix-Set/blob/master/schemas/tms/2.0/json/tileSet.json[schema for tileset metadata],
 as defined by the 2D Tile Matrix Set and Tileset Metadata standard 2.0.
^|B |If the tileset uses a tile matrix set registered in the OGC TileMatrixSet registry, the `tileMatrixSetURI` property SHALL link to the registered TileMatrixSet at `http://opengis.net/def/tms/{tileMatrixSet}`
^|C |If the tileset is a custom TileMatrixSet (i.e. not registered on the OGC TileMatrixSet registry), the `tileMatrixSetDefinition` property SHALL link to a TileMatrixSet definition following the
 https://github.com/opengeospatial/2D-Tile-Matrix-Set/blob/master/schemas/tms/2.0/json/tileMatrixSet.json[tile matrix set schema], as defined by the 2D Tile Matrix Set and Tileset Metadata standard 2.0.
^|D |The tileset metadata SHALL include at least one templated link to individual tiles using the relation type `"item"`, and the template parameters
 `{tileMatrix}`, and `{tileRow}` and `{tileCol}`. Those variables are to be substituted by their respective valid values to obtain the URL to a tile.
^|E |If a tiles link template is specific to a particular format, it SHALL contain the media type for that format in the `"type"` property. Otherwise, normal HTTP content type negotiation rules shall apply (`Accept:` header).
^|F |A property `templated` with a boolean `true` value SHALL be part of the link properties to indicate that the link needs to be processed to substitute the templated variables with valid values before being used as a URL to a tile.
